/**
 * Universe scan — the data behind 🔥 High Probability Setups.
 *
 * Coverage comes from two sources merged into one answer:
 *
 *  * a live scan of the top `depth` symbols by 24 h volume, computed now;
 *  * every symbol the background worker has scanned recently, read from the
 *    database.
 *
 * The split exists because a live sweep of all ~530 perpetuals would blow
 * through Binance's rate limit inside a single page load. The response reports
 * exactly where its coverage came from, so the UI can say "100 scanned live,
 * 430 from the worker" rather than implying it looked at everything itself.
