/**
 * Outcome analysis — why a signal worked, and who was right.
 *
 * Runs once, when a signal closes. Two jobs:
 *
 *  1. Measure what price actually did after entry (`computeExcursion`), so
 *     "it went to target" and "it spiked 3R against us first and then went to
 *     target" are not recorded as the same result.
 *  2. Classify *why* (`classifyOutcome`), and attribute it — which analyst's
 *     confirmation carried the trade, which ones were wrong, and which ones
 *     abstained and were vindicated.
 *
 * The classification vocabulary is a small closed set (`OutcomeReason`) rather
 * than free text, so the same reason can be counted across hundreds of
 * signals. That counting is what makes per-analyst performance measurable —
 * and per the brief, those statistics evaluate the analysts. They never feed
 * back into signal generation: `evaluateConfluence` cannot see them.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous, so every branch is testable without a database.
