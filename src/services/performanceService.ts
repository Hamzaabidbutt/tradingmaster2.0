/**
 * Per-analyst and overall performance, derived from closed signals.
 *
 * Deliberately **derived on read** rather than kept as counters. Stored
 * counters are a second source of truth that drifts from the signals they
 * claim to summarise the first time a row is edited, back-filled, or a signal
 * is re-evaluated — and there is no way to notice the drift. Deriving also
 * satisfies "statistics update automatically as signals reach their outcome"
 * for free: the outcome *is* the statistic.
 *
 * Attribution rule: an analyst's record covers the signals it **supported** —
 * where it cleared its quality gate and pointed the way the signal went.
 *
 *  * An analyst that **abstained** is not charged. Charging abstentions as
 *    losses would make the quality gates in confluence.ts look like a defect
 *    rather than the point, and would push the system toward always voting.
 *  * An analyst that **opposed** a losing signal is credited separately
 *    (`correctlyOpposed`), because being right against the crowd is real
 *    information about that analyst.
 *
 * These numbers exist to *evaluate* the analysts. Nothing here is readable by
 * `evaluateConfluence`, which takes no stats parameter — so history can never
 * push a signal the present chart does not support.
