/**
 * Universe scanner — finds the best setups across every USDT perpetual.
 *
 * The terminal answers "what is this coin doing?". This answers the question
 * the terminal structurally cannot: "of everything trading right now, where is
 * the strongest setup, long or short?"
 *
 * Two costs govern every decision in this file:
 *
 *  * **Binance weight.** ~530 perpetuals at 10 weight per klines call is 5300
 *    against a ~2400/min IP budget, so a naive full sweep gets the server
 *    rate-limited (429) and then temporarily banned (418). Hence: rank the
 *    universe from a *single* all-tickers call, scan the top N on demand, and
 *    let the worker cover the long tail in rolling slices.
 *  * **CPU per symbol.** `analyzeMarket()` runs ~25 engines and five network
 *    fetches. Confluence needs three engines and one fetch, so `scanSymbol`
 *    calls those three directly. Scanning 100 symbols through the full
 *    orchestrator would be roughly 500 requests; this way it is 100.
